# Inspirative demographic (art)work
*And time to time we are also ask to share some other interesting and inspirational things. We think that demography is not just some scientific field, but it could be much more – fun, cognition, art and much more.* 

### (Tak trochu jiná) doporučená demografická literatura
*Note: Unfortunately, this poetry collection named "(A slightly different) recommended demographic literature" was written in Czech and there is no English translation (yet!).* 

Básnická sbírka plná inspirativních básní a jiných životních mouder s čistě demografickou tématikou. Najdete v ní zrýmované postupy konstrukce demografických ukazatelů, demografické variace klasické poezie a mnoho dalšího. [Ve formátu pdf ji můžete otevřít a stáhnout zde.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBIUUbv_bBFUAle0fTP3OG8jhuMoHkBr/view?usp=sharing)
