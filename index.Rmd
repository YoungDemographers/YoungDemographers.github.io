Welcome to the **Young Demographers'** webpage. 

The fact that you made it here means, that you have probabably heard about us before, which makes us jump by joy! 
However, if you need any other information, you will most likely find it here.
If you have any questions please write us to: yd.demographers@gmail.com. 

We hope to see you in person in Prague or anywhere else. 


If you talk about us on your social media, please use **#YoungDemographers**. 
We also encourage you to talk about us offline with your collegues, friends, peers, grandmas, and spread the word that "Demography is fun!"
